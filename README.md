# Sandbox-Game

## About
This is a sandbox game made with Python, meaning that there is not really a story and the player can build whatever they want and explore the world. Currently the player can only make paths with the shovel, but
farmland will be added very soon.

## Controls
Use either the arrow keys or WASD to move around.
Press 'e' to open the inventory and use the mouse to move around items.
Press 'p' to create a path when the shovel is selected.
